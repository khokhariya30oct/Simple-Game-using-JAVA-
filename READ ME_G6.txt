1)In this game,we have used a thread to make a flow continuesly of Random object.
2)This random object contain either red or green color.
3)To use Random value we've used Random method in java.
4)For making more interesting level we speed up the moving object .for that we've used Thread.sleep(); 
5)There are 2 Static object are on left and right side of flow,so based on this static object's color you 
    have to press either "a" or "d".
6)"a" or "d" will compare left hand sided object or rigtht hand sided with current object of flow and check by color.
7) if player have sort in right manner then point will increment ,on wrong decision Game over.
8)one more thing,atleast you have to press any before object of flow reach to the bottom.
9)you can press any key but it will consider which key you pressed last and based on last key it'll check.
